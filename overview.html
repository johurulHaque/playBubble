		<h2>HTML - Elements</h2>

		<p>
			An HTML element is defined by a starting tag.
			If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash as shown below with few tags −
			<br />So here <var><</var>p>....<var><</var>/p>is an HTML element,<br />There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed, <br /><span style="border-left:2px solid blue;background:lightgreen">such as <var><</var>img.../>, <var><</var>hr /> and <var><</var>br /> elements.</span> <mark>These are known as void elements.</mark>
		</p>

		<h2>HTML Tag vs. Element</h2>

		<p>
			An HTML element is defined by a starting tag.<br /> If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.<br />
			For example, <var><</var>p> is starting tag of a paragraph and <var><</var>/p> is closing tag of the same paragraph but<var><</var>p>This is paragraph<var><</var>/p> is a paragraph element.
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Note:</b>HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.<br />br is an empty element without a closing tag (the br tag defines a line break).<br />
			Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <var><</var>br />.</br />
			HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.

		<!-- What is a favicon? -->
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">What is a favicon?</h2>
		<p>
			<u>Favicons add that extra polish that visitors (and clients) appreciate.</u>
			<b>A favicon  (short for favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, </b>
			<span title="using span tag" style="background-color:tomato">is a file containing one or more small icons</span>, associated with a particular website or web page.<br />
			You have probably seen many favicons before, even if you don’t know what they are. <br />
		</p>


		<!--What’s the purpose of a favicon? OR Why should you use a favicon? -->
		<h3>What’s the purpose of a favicon? OR Why should you use a favicon?</h3>
		<p>
			Favicon is the shortcut from the Favorites icon.It is a small logo found in front of the visited URL, it can be seen in Address Bar, <span style="background-color:lightgreen;">and is used to promote a company or a trademark.</span><br />
			Favicons are used in all modern browsers at the address bar, in the links bar, in the bookmarking area and in its browsing tabs.<br />
		    <u>I mentioned above, and if you care about your user experience, you must care about favicons.</u><br />
		</p>

		<p style="-margin-left-border:5px; border-left-color:red; background-color:gray;">


			I will tell you the icon basics.<b><mark> Please not, renaming a jpg, png etc. won't work, it has to be an ico file.</mark></b><br />
		</p>


		<h2><u>How do I make an icon file?</u></h2>
		<p>
			Open your image editing software. To open Paint, open the Start menu and select the search box. ...<br />
			Choose an image. Decide on an image (any image type, as long as its supported by the program you use) to convert into an icon. ...<br />
			Change the size of the image. ...<br />
			<mark>Save your icon as an .ico file.</mark><br />
		</p>

		<h2>How To Get Your Favicon To Show</h2>
		<h3>There are 2 different ways to do this:</h3>
		<p>
			Method 1:<br>
			This is the easiest to do and it will show your icon no matter what page your visitor adds to their favorites.<br />
			Simply upload your new icon to the main directory of your site, ie. www.example.com/favicon.ico.<br />
			Method 2:<br />
			If you don't have access to your root directory (if your on a free server for example) or it you want a different favicon for certain pages, add this to the <var><</var>head> of your html.
			(You can name your favicon whatever you'd like with this method)<br />

			<mark><var><</var>link rel="shortcut icon" href="/folder-name/logo.ico"></mark>
			Or if you prefer to use the full URL:<br />
			<mark><var><</var>link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.ico"><br></mark><br />
			<b>Note:</b><br />
			The first time (OK.. I admit it, the second time to) that I tried to add a favicon I got rather confused when I decided to change it.
			If you upload a new one, be sure to clear your cache for the new icon to show up ;-)
			It’s true, favicons are very little things, probably the least important bit of a site, but it’s attention to detail that makes a site stand out; and even if it sounds crazy,<span style="background-color:lightgreen;"> favicons are very important from a branding point-of-view.</span>
		</p>

		<!--The Technical Details-->
		<h2>The Technical Details</h2>
		<p>
			<b>The Size/What is the size of an icon?</b><br />
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li><u>Images for favicons should be 16x16 pixels.</u></li>
				<li>Favicons are small square images usually 16×16 pixels which are used</li>
				<li><u><em><b><mark>A favicon must have the following characteristics. name - favicon.ico. size - 32x32 or 16x16 pixels.</mark></b></em></u></li>
				<li><span style="background-color:tomato;">
					A Icons are image files that actually contain one or more images, so a good idea is to make the 16x16 size as well as a 48x48 for windows desktops and
					if you want you could go to the higher Mac sizes size (128x128). When you've done that, name your file favicon.ico.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>According to the Vista UI Guidelines, the standard sizes are 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 (XP standard sizes do not include the 256x256 icon</li>
				<li>You can either resize an existing photo, or create a tiny image specifically for use as a favicon.</li>
				<li>When resizing a larger photo to be this small, you'll often lose important details or end up with a fuzzy image.</li>
				<li><u>To avoid this, you'll likely want to do some touch-up work after downsizing the larger photo. Or, just start with a 16x16 canvas to avoid resizing issues altogether.</u></li>
			</ul>
			  <br />
			 <br />
			<img src="icon3.PNG" alt="title" /><br />

			<!--What To Show-->
			<br /><b>What To Show</b><br />
			Because you only have 256 pixels to work with, it can be a little challenging to know what to include in a favicon. Here are some common ideas:<br />
			<blockquote><q><span style="background-color:lightgreen;">Use your logo (or part of it)
			If your logo doesn't display well at such a small size, use a stylized version of the first letter (or letters) of your site or business name
			Use an icon that communicates what your site does or represents (for example, Google Analytics uses a tiny chart for their favicon)</span></blockquote></q>

			<br /><b>The Image Format</b><br />
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>Creating a website favicon is easy as pie. As a matter of fact, you don’t even need to be a designer to do that.</li>
				<li><u>As the name suggests, favicons must use the icon (.ico) file format.All you need to do is create a 16x16 image.</u></li>
				<li> The .ico format supports transparency, so you're not limited to creating a square icon.If you want to take advantage of transparency, use the .gif or .png format when creating your image.</li>
				<li>Enter a file name for the icon and type “.ico” (without quotations) as the file extension. </li>
			</ul>
			<blockquote>Create a 16x16 image. <mark>If you want transparency, use the PNG or GIF format.</mark>
			Convert your image to .ico format using a free service such as favicon.cc.
			Upload the new icon to http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico . For finer control, use the code above to specify favicons on a page-by-page basis.</blockquote>


			<!--Where It Goes-->
			<br /><b>Where It Goes</b><br />
			<ul>
				<li>Originally, favicons had to be named exactly favicon.ico and placed at the root of your domain (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico).</li>
				<li>This meant that you could only have one favicon per domain, period. However, as favicons have become standardized, more flexibility has been added. There are now two approaches:</li>
			</ul>


			<img src="icon4.PNG" alt="title" /><br />

			<!--One Favicon For Entire Domain-->
			<br /><b><mark>One Favicon For Entire Domain</mark></b><br />
			<ul type="circle">
				<li style="background:orange;">If you only want one favicon for your entire domain, simply save the favicon.ico file to the root folder of your site. When uploaded, it must be accessible from http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico .</li>
				<li>As soon as you upload the file, your browser should start displaying the icon for all pages on your site.</li>
				<li>If not, clear your browser cache and reload the page.</li>
			</ul>

			<!--Page-Specific Favicons-->
			<br /><b><mark>Page-Specific Favicons</mark></b><br />
			<ul>
				<li>If you want more control (and to be a little more standards-compliant), you can specify favicons on a page-by-page basis.</li>
				<li style="background:orange;">To use this approach, save the .ico file anywhere within your site, such as an images/ folder. Then add the following code to your page:<br />
				<var><</var>link rel="shortcut icon" href="/images/specialicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" /></li>
				<li>Update the highlighted path to reference your new icon file. </li>
			</ul>

			<blockquote><b>Note:</b> that we use a site-relative path (starting with a slash) so that it will be a valid link regardless of the current page's path.<br />
			When using this approach, you'll still want to upload a fallback icon to http://www.yourdomain.com/favicon.ico for situations where someone is browsing or bookmarking non-HTML content (such as a PDF).
			Let's Review: How To Do It, The Easy Way.</blockquote>

			<!--Conclusion-->
			<b>Conclusion</b><br />
			<blockquote>Adding a favicon is so easy, there's no excuse not to.<mark> Favicons are important for site recognition and branding, and should always be added to your sites.</mark><br />
			I hope this guide has removed the mystery behind those little icons, and empowered you to add them to your sites!</blockquote>

		<br /><h2>Why does Favicon.ico Show Up as a 404 in the log files?</h2>
		<p>
			<blockquote><mark>I was confused when this first started showing up, if I'd never had a file called that... why were people looking for it?</mark> <br />
			The answer is simple, all it means is that people with browsers that use favicon (Internet Explorer 5.0 +, Firefox, Opera and a most others) are visiting your site.<br />
			While seeing a 404 in your log files usually means that a visitor got the dreaded "404 Page Not Found" error, in this case it doesn't. <br />
			All it means is that the default icon was shown instead of a custom one, your visitors saw no errors :-)</blockquote><br />
